## Time Series Intro

This project follows along some simple time series exercises. 


### Getting the data

The data for this project is stored using DAGsHUB. To fetch the data
you need to install a command-line tool called `dvc`, short for "data
version control". For instructions on how to do that go
[here](https://dvc.org/doc/install).

Once you have installed DVC, you need to "pull" it from the cloud
storage area. To do that, navigate to `projects/time-series-intro` and
run this command: `dvc pull`. It may take a bit of time for the data
to come down.
